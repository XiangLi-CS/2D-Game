CSC3232-Game Technologies and Simulations-Coursework-Unity   Newcastle University

This is a coursework project that I completed at the university. The aim of this project is to use the Unity game engine to create a video game that incorporates the different elements, includes physics, graphic effects, AI, UI, audio and emergent gameplay. The above PDF document outlines the features I implemented in this project. You can also view the result by the link below.

All of the assets (meshes/audio/textures) were downloaded free from Unity asset store.
